        <h1>What Is Universal Design?</h1>
        <p>
          Universal design is about creating one flexible experience that works for as many people as possible, instead
          of building separate “normal” and “accessible” versions.

          <h2 id="what-main-heading">Definition in Simple Terms</h2>

          <p>
            Universal design means planning products, spaces, and digital content so they can be used, understood, and
            navigated by people with different bodies, senses, and abilities without needing special add-ons or
            alternate versions.
          </p>

          <p>
            On the web, that means designing pages so people can perceive, understand, navigate, and contribute whether
            they use a mouse, keyboard, screen reader, magnification, captions, or other assistive technology.

          <p>
            Universal design focuses on removing barriers before they appear. Instead of fixing problems later, we
            design with a wide range of users in mind from the start.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>One shared design that adapts, instead of separate “special” versions</li>
            <li>Flexible layouts that work on phones, tablets, and large screens</li>
            <li>Structure and markup that make content understandable to both people and assistive tech</li>

          <p>
            Accessibility is a core part of universal design. Accessible sites follow standards so people with
            disabilities can use them; universal design goes a step further and aims to make those sites easier and
            clearer for everyone.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Accessibility focuses on removing specific barriers</li>
            <li>Universal design looks at the full experience for all users</li>
            <li>Together, they support a web that is more inclusive and usable</li>
