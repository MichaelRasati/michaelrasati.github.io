        <h1>Why Universal Design Matters</h1>
        <p>
          Universal design on the web is about making sure everyone can use the same sites and tools, no matter their
          body, senses, or situation.
        </p>

          <h2 id="why-main-heading">Equal access for everyone</h2>

          <p>
            So many parts of life now happen online: classes, banking, health care, social life, and work. When a site
            is accessible, people with disabilities can take part in these everyday tasks with the same independence and
            privacy as everyone else.
          </p>

          <p>
            Accessible design supports people who use screen readers, keyboard navigation, captions, magnification, or
            other assistive technology. It also helps people in everyday situations, like using a phone in bright
            sunlight or reading late at night.

            <li>People in tough environments, such as noisy rooms, bright glare, or slow internet connections</li>

          <p>
            For organizations and creators, accessibility is both practical and ethical. It reaches more people, reduces
            legal risk, and shows respect for users who rely on assistive tech.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Improves usability and clarity for all visitors</li>
            <li>Helps meet legal and policy expectations around digital access</li>
            <li>Builds trust and signals that everyone is welcome on the site</li>
